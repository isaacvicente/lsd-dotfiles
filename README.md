# LSD Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles used in [LSD](https://www.lsd.ufcg.edu.br).
Of course, there's nothing private here, just my configs.

## TODO
- [ ] Create the Ansible playbook(s).
- [ ] Install `vim`, `neovim`, `stow`, `tldr`, etc.
- [ ] Stow configs.
- [ ] etc.

Managed by [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).
